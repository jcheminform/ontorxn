## Overview
**OntoRXN** is an ontology developed for expressing chemical reaction networks (RXNets) characterized from computational calculations. These RXNets are expressed as *undirected* graphs, without preassigning any kind of directionality inside the networks. Properties from the individual calculations conforming the mechanisms are defined with base on the [OntoCompChem](http://theworldavatar.com/ontology/ontocompchem/) ontology.

While the ontology standard may be used as required, the  [ontorxn-tools](https://gitlab.com/dgarayr/ontorxn_tools) Python library has been developed to facilitate the instantiation of OntoRXN-compliant graphs from the reaction networks defined in the Create module of [ioChem-BD](https://www.iochem-bd.org/).

## Main structure
The core definition of networks in OntoRXN implies a multi-level structure comprised of four main classes.
- CompCalculation. Individual calculation results based on OntoCompChem, parsed from output or (preferably) fetched from the CML files generated by ioChem-BD.
- ChemSpecies. Individual chemical entities for which calculations have been carried out.
- NetworkStage. Collections of chemical entities (molecules) required to fulfill atom consistency across the network, to be able to compute relative energies against any possible reference state.
- ReactionStep. Elementary, undirected reaction step.
